# Joat - Jack-of-all-trades

# UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Jack-of-all-trades is a little development tool with several features. It is based on an
arduino nano and uses a 2x16 character display.

## Planned features:

* programming AVR microcontrollers using the serial/SPI technique.
* resetting the fuses and erasing AVR microcontrollers using the HVP technique.
* a frequency meter
* a capacitance meter
* an inductance meter
* anything else I can think of that will fit in the flash

### AVR programmer

Based on the ArduinoISP sketch that is part of the arduino 1.8.13 release. BSD license -

### AVT HVP

Inspired by ... (tbd)

### Frequency meter

Originally developed by the author as part of the analogue-synth module in
https://github.com/TheLancashireman/synthesiser

### Capacitance meter

The code was stolen from https://www.circuitbasics.com/how-to-make-an-arduino-capacitance-meter/

After more research the original was found at

The calculation was eventually published under GPLv3 at https://github.com/codewrite/arduino-capacitor

### Inductance meter
